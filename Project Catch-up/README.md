# Reading Platform Database – Inspired by Bookmate

This repository contains the academic deliverables for a database development project focused on designing the data layer of a digital reading platform inspired by **Bookmate**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a normalized relational database to support the core functionalities of a reading platform, such as:

- Book and audiobook management
- User profiles and social interactions
- Reviews, favorites, and recommendations
- Subscription control and Premium access
- Scalable and maintainable architecture for future system integration

The database was developed based on detailed user stories, functional requirements, and a business model canvas.
